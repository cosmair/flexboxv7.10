                <p>Our work is done in the beautiful mountains of North Carolina with our ever-growing family of insightful and intuitive code writers. The journey into tech started with our backgrounds in journalism, writing, and publishing. Sharing these stories online brought fascination with how easily we could get our voices heard. Sharing these stories online brought fascination with how easily we could get our voices heard. That experience drove us to create websites for our own specific needs. Once that curiosity was transformed into functional format a door was opened that could never be shut. </p>

                <p>Users have a positive expressive response to your visual design. This is almost always a positive aspect from your perspective. This effect is a major reason why a higher quality user experience can’t just be a functional UI — designing an interface that’s eye-catching as well as practical is worth the resources. Samsung’s success is an excellent example of the aggressive advantage of paying attention to aesthetics. As designers, we’re often faced with conditions where we have to blueprint for a lot of information to be displayed in a small space.</p>
